To the NSF HNDS-R review committee:

If the proposal submitted by Drs. Brewer and Codding entitled "Resilience of Coupled Human-Hydrological Networks to Correlated and Uncorrelated Climatic Shocks" is selected for funding by NSF, it is my intent to collaborate and/or commit resources as detailed in the Project Description or the Facilities, Equipment or Other Resources section of the proposal.
