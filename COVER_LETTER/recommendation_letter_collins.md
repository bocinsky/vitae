\today

Dear Dr. Vidon,

I am writing in support of Meghan Collins being promoted to Rank III (Associate Research Scientist) at the Desert Research Institute. I've worked closely with Meghan since joining the Division of Earth and Ecosystem Sciences as an hourly assistant research professor in 2016 as part of the Native Waters on Arid Lands (NWAL) project. I am currently collaborating with Meghan on multiple research, extension and education projects, including the Teaching Native Waters project, which Meghan leads. During the time I've known her, Meghan has become a leader in transforming DRI's scholarship into action through public education and community engagement. Meghan is a generous, conscientious and dependable colleague who has been highly successful in keeping several high-profile projects on track despite the many challenges over the past several years. She has demonstrated success in multiple areas that qualify her for this promotion, including project development and management; development of funding; supervisory responsibility; and service to many communities (especially Indigenous communities) and DRI. Here, I will briefly highlight our work together and the impact Meghan has had on DRI's research and outreach activities.

I met Meghan when I joined the NWAL project in 2016 as a paleoclimatologist and archaeologist. My role in the project was to join other scientists in a series of workshops held for Native American agricultural producers and hosted by tribal agricultural extension agents. At earlier interations of these workshops, community members told NWAL leadership that while they certainly saw how the information presented benefited themselves and their communities, our project really needed to be reaching the next generation. Meghan met that challenge by developing a series of youth events alongside our producer workshops and tribal climate summits. Meghan brought native high school students together with DRI environmental scientists and faculty from tribal colleges (TCU) to learn STEM skills and have discussions around climate resilience in their communities. Meghan was passionate about making these events meaningful for native students, and privileged Indigenous voices during the events by co-producing them with TCUs. Through these events, I learned from Meghan how introducing students to applied environmental science can lead directly to them pursuing STEM careers.

In our many collaborations since those youth events Meghan has expanded her educational outreach and programming, often with an eye towards increasing equity and diversity in STEM fields. In February 2020 Meghan led the development of the Teaching Native Waters project, for which funding was awarded during the summer of 2020. Teaching Native Waters envisioned the creation of a "community of Practice" of educators of Native students who together would develop skills and curricula in place-based environmental education. The project was structured as a series of multi-day workshops in southwestern Colorado---the Covid-19 pandemic intervened in those plans, but Meghan rapidly led the pivot to a series of on line modules for educators that included live demonstrations and experiential learning, in-depth conversations with content experts, and asynchronous dialog and resource sharing through a dedicated web portal. Many of the technologies that Meghan deployed were not in wide use when the project started but became essential as remote meetings became commonplace. The use of these technologies helped maintain high flexibility for educators and presenters alike, which I feel really increased participation and therefore enhanced the impact of the program. We are currently launching the second year of Teaching Native Waters (also remote), and Meghan is once again adapting to rapidly changing circumstances. She negotiated a re-allocation of resources with funders and project partners in order to support additional DRI staff as part of the project, and has formed and led a very effective team. Meghan's success at adapting Teaching Native Waters to the demands and constraints of the past two years makes it likely that she will be successful in developing and funding future outreach that brings DRI research directly into K–12 classrooms.

Meghan is expanding the impact of her work on Teaching Native Waters by mentoring an Indigenous climate education fellow as part of the newly-launched Native Climate project at DRI. Meghan and the Native Climate fellow will co-develop new initiatives to being climate science from DRI and the USDA Climate Hubs to K–12 educators and students by building on the programs and relationships Meghan has developed over the past six years. Meghan will also join Kelsey Fitzgerald in helping develop a Native Climate reporting internship program that will engage Indigenous students in Nevada and across the West to tell stories of climate resilience in Indian Country.

Meghan's ongoing work at DRI on community engagement and education projects are essential broader impacts of DRI's research. Meghan's projects not only advertise DRI research; they demonstrate the relevance of that research in bettering peoples' lives. That she has been so successful in attracting and maintaining funding for these projects is only one testament to the value she brings to the Institute. (I wouldn't be surprised if her efforts enhance grant-making success across the institution.) But it is also her incredible kindness, insatiable curiosity and professional drive that make her a great asset to DRI and deserving of recognition.

Meghan is very well-qualified for promotion to Rank III at DRI---she is not only a collegial and effective leader, but through her outreach work Meghan is also an incredible ambassador for the Institute. I sincerely hope you and the promotion committee will elect to award Meghan Collins this much-deserved promotion.
