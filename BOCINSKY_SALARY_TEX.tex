\opening{Dear Ms. Fish,}
 
This letter relates my salary history since receiving my PhD in December 2014.

From January 2015 to the present I have been salaried faculty at Washington State University as a post-doctoral researcher. My salary is \$45,000 per year, plus benefits totalling approximately \$15,000, including faculty health and dental insurance, a \$25,000 term life insurance policy, long-term disability insurance, and participation in the WSU retirement plan (with 100\% matching contributions) vended with TIAA-CREF. I currently receive 10 paid holidays per year, and accrue annual leave at a rate of 14.67 hours per month (approx. 22 days per year) and 8 hours of sick leave per month. Also, last year I was written into a grant proposal as a post-doc where, had it been funded, I would have had a starting salary of \$60,000 annually.

According to the \href{https://www.higheredjobs.com/salary/salaryDisplay.cfm?SurveyID=24}{\bf{HigherEdJobs.com}}, as an assistant professor in the social sciences, I could expect a starting salary ranging from \$58,000 to \$68,000 plus benefits. One recent starting faculty member in the Department of Anthropology at Washington State University had a starting salary of \$64,000; another received \$75,000. In the \href{https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2015/RUS.pdf}{\bf{Federal government}}, I am qualified for positions at the GS-9 or GS-11 level, with locality-based salaries in non-urban areas ranging from \$48,000 to \$75,000 plus benefits, although positions requiring technical expertise in Geographic Information Systems or related technologies often pay considerably more.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
